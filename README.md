## Usage
1) Ensure that MySQL is running on your system.
2) Install the database and tables using the schema.sql file in the db folder. This will give you 3 tables with the correct column names.
3) You can then either add your own data with the program, or you can start with dummy data by using the seed.sql file in the same folder.
3) If you haven't already, be sure to go to the Employee_Tracker folder in your system in the terminal and run ```nmp install``` (or ```nmp i```).
4) Start the application by typing ```node app``` in the terminal, and you will be prompted with questions to answer.
5) Choose the task that you want to complete with the application and answer all questions that follow.
6) When you are done with the task, the inital question will be asked again, and you will be prompted to choose a task.
7) When you are done, choose to exit the applcation (choice #12).
